# MIT Links

A gigantic collection of all the MIT links I think might be useful, many from the Facebook group. Sending me extra links and descriptions to add is super welcome, as are [pull requests to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/betaveros/mit) if you know how, but I want this to be a links page so I prefer short descriptions. Some attempt is made to future-proof this so it might be useful for future students. Subpages might be different.

## Subpages

- [academics]({% post_url 2015-08-23-academics %}) --- requirements, course evaluations, etc.
- [tech]({% post_url 2015-08-23-tech %})nical details

## Important Links

- [Certificate Server](https://ca.mit.edu/ca/). Okay, unless you're paranoid and make certificates that expire early, you should only need to do this once per year. But that once per year (late July / early August) may come right before a few important prefrosh deadlines and leave you confused for a while. When it rolls around and you see SSL errors, remember this and don't panic.
- ["First Year at MIT" portal for c/o 2019](https://web.mit.edu/firstyear/2019/). This has 2019 in the title and URL so is obviously not future-proof. It has most of the important links, but not all of them!
- [WebSIS (Student Information System) for Students](http://student.mit.edu/cgi-docs/student.html), which links to lots of other things...
  - [MITPAY](http://student.mit.edu/ent/cgi-bin/mitpay.pl): pay your bills
  - [Financial Record](https://student.mit.edu/cgi-docs/rspwstop.html) >> [ Student Information Review Form](https://student.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rrpwssirf.sh): fill this out to get your scholarship, if you have one
- [MIT Emergency Information](http://emergency.mit.net/)

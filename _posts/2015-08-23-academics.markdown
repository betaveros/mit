# Requirements

Overviews:

- [MIT First Year Academics, by Angus Lai](https://wllai.scripts.mit.edu:444/mit/frosh.php)
- [MITAdmissions / CLAAASS (Yuliya K.)](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/claaass)

[Online Freshman Advising Folder](https://edu-apps.mit.edu/testscores/FFControl).

The [Subject Listing](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/index.cgi) is probably most important and reasonably well-documented, although I have a tl;dr below. There are at least three additional unofficial tools for choosing courses:

- [CourseRoad](https://courseroad.mit.edu/), for plotting courses and their prerequisites and corequisites over the semesters of four years
- [Planner](http://planner.mit.edu/), for scheduling courses in a particular semester, automatically helps you picks time periods to avoid conflicts and shows you all alternatives
- [Picker](https://picker.mit.edu/), for finding courses in a particular semester and also scheduling them, doesn't have the automatic conflict avoidance and list of alternatives, but has a better (imo) color scheme

Just one benchmark I wish I knew earlier: a "normal" course is **12** units. Most exceptions are less than 12.

## [Subject Listing](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/index.cgi) Quick Rundown

The "help" section is helpful (unlike some help sections on other websites) and explains pretty much everything. But here's a short version:

- Wheat = fall; flower = spring.
- The grey wheat/flower button adds something to your [selections / tentative schedule](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/viewcookie.cgi). But clicking one isn't a commitment or anything; the help even says

  > You can use this collection page to select the subjects you find interesting, and then print the page ... to keep a permanent reference.

  Do note that the tentative schedule is stored in cookies on your computer, so it won't still be there if you switch computers.
- Units X-Y-Z (e.g. 3-2-7) indicate about X hours for recitation/lecture, Y hours for labs/etc., Z hours for preparing (studying by yourself?) per week. X + Y + Z is how many units of credit the course is worth.
- Prereq(uisites) are courses you must have taken before taking this course.
- Coreq(uisites) are courses you must take concurrently with this course. (I'm guessing it's also allowed that you've taken them earlier because some corequisites would be really weird otherwise for people with advanced standing but I haven't gotten anybody to tell me yet.)
- A solid Forbidden sign (slashed circle) means it's not available this year. A fuzzy Forbidden sign means it won't be available next year, so maybe get it while it's available.
